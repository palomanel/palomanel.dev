Hello there!

I'm [Paulo Albuquerque](https://github.com/palomanel) and this is
my personal development blog.
Here you can find the record of my experiments, including useful
insights, learnings from my failures, and an occasional rant.

You can check the source code and the scaffolding for this blog on
[GitHub](https://github.com/palomanel/palomanel.dev). It is hosted on
[GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and built with
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
